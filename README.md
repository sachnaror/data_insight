# Django Data Analysis App ðŸ“Š

This Django application allows users to upload datasets, perform data analysis using AI techniques, and visualize the results through interactive plots. It also includes functionality for generating sample datasets using Faker.

Think of it as your personal data scientist, but without the fancy coffee and the existential dread of knowing the world is ending.

## Features

- Upload CSV datasets and analyze them. (No more staring at spreadsheets like they're the Mona Lisa!)
- Generate sample datasets using Faker for testing and development. (Because sometimes you just need some fake data to make your app look good.)
- Perform linear regression analysis and visualize the results with Matplotlib. (Regression analysis? More like regression to the mean... of awesomeness!)
- Display summary statistics and correlation matrices for the uploaded datasets. (Numbers, numbers everywhere!)
- User authentication for personalized data management. (Because your data is precious, like a unicorn's tears.)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the application on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-data-analysis-app.git
   cd django-data-analysis-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a .env file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**

## How It Works

The Django Data Analysis App leverages the power of Django, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Faker to provide a user-friendly interface for data analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework.
- **Pandas:** A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib:** A comprehensive plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Faker:** A library for generating realistic fake data.
